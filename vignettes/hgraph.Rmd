## Introduction

The `hgraph` object offers a few functions to deal with adjacency matrices
which are for instance created from the `simul` module. This module is a
simple R environment and can be inspected therefor using the `ls` function.
  

```{r}
library(hanna)  
ls(hgraph)
```

There are as well a few private functions which should not be used directly be the programmer.

```{r}
ls(hgraph,all=TRUE)
```

These private functions are starting with a dot at the beginning.

## Creating an example graph 

```{r fig.width=9,fig.height=6}
W=hgraph$graph()
cols=hgraph$colors(W)
hgraph$plot(W,vertex.color=cols)
```
