## Introduction

Below you find the code for the paper ...

```{r}
x=1
print(x)
```

Season pairings:

```{r}
library(hanna)
simul_pairings(LETTERS[1:4])
```

Play a single round:

```{r}
res=simul_season(LETTERS[1:6])
res
```

Let's now conver this to an undirected graph where edges are drawn between
teams which draw against each other:

```{r}
U = simul_graph(res$M,mode='draw')
U
```

Now a directed graph where an edge is drawn from the winning team to the loosing team in a match.

```{r}
D = simul_graph(res$M,mode='win')
D
```
